        <p>Argentina is one of the giants among national football teams and the population is known for its immense football passion; Jonathan Wilson writes in Angels with Dirty Faces: <blockquote>“No country so intellectualizes its soccer, so loves its theories and its myths”.</blockquote>
        <p> When talking of Argentina in context of football it impossible to leapfrog <strong>Diego Maradona</strong> and <strong>Lionel Messi</strong>, two of the greatest football players of all time.</p>

                    <p>When the first edition of the Campeonato Sudamericano (the predecessor of the Copa América) was played in 1916, Argentina was the host. At this time, South American football was dominated by Argentina and Uruguay and it was the neighbor in the east that often got the upper hand. It would happen in the 1916 final and was repeated in the Summer Olympics 12 years later and in the first World Cup another 14 years later</p>
                    <p>Argentina would win its first Campeonato Sudamericano title in 1921 and three more victories would follow in the same decade. It was obvious at the time that Argentina could compete with the best teams in Europe; during a tour on the continent in 1925, Argentina won 16 out of 19 games.</p>
                    <p>Before the establishment of the World Cup, the Olympic Games yielded as the most prestigious international tournament. Argentina participated in the tournament for the first time in 1928. The team run through the tournament in superior style, winning by a combined score of 23-5 before facing the big rival Uruguay in the final. The game finished 1-1, which led to a rematch three days later, which was won by Uruguay 2 to 1. </p>
                    <p>In the first World Cup, played in Uruguay, Argentina would be one of the 13 participating teams. They won their group ahead of Chile, France and Mexico and after destroying USA by 6-1 in the semi-finals they would once again meet Uruguay in an immortal final. This was probably the biggest game so far in Argentine football and over 10,000 Argentine supporters went to Montevideo to see the match at the Estadio Centenario. Uruguay would take the lead, but two goals from Carlos Peucelle and Guillermo Stábile would put Argentina ahead. Nevertheless, the outcome would once again be Argentine frustration.</p>

                <p>The 1982 World Cup coincided with the Falklands War. The Argentine press did their best to imply that Argentine was the stronger part; the players of the Argentina got therefore chocking news after their arrival to Europe and reading Spanish newspaper commentating the war from an objective angle – Argentine was clearly losing in the conflict.</p>
                <p>Directly from the first match it stood clear that the 1982 version of the Argentina team couldn’t match the champion standard of 1978, although Maradona was in the squad. They lost their first match against Belgium but rebounded with victories in the two following group matches.</p>
                <p>In the second round Argentina ended up together with Italy and Brazil and did lose both their games. Italy that defeated the Albiceleste with 2-1 would go on and win the trophy. Shortly after the 1982 World Cup, Menotti resigned and Carlos Bilardo who had been successful with Estudiantes was chosen as the new national team coach. Carlos Bilardo may have been remembered as a truly successful coach, taking Argentina to two world cup finals. But this was an era in which the average result seen over all competition matches was the worst ever for the team. In the 1980s, Argentina came as best on the third place in the Copa América.</p>
                <p>Best remembered is of course the golden 1986 World Cup event in Mexico. The victory has often been referred to one man, but things are, of course, little more multifaceted in football. On the tactical side, Argentina had an ace up the sleeve – a 3-5-2 formation that was first tested by Bilardo in 1984.</p>
                <p>Many stars were anticipated to give outstanding performance in Mexico that summer, such as Enzo Francescoli, Michel Platini, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Hugo Sánchez. But one player would over-shadow the rest, Diego Maradona who did 5 goals and 5 assists (Argentina did 14 goals in the tournament).</p>
                <p>Argentina had no problems to progress from their group after two victories and one draw. Maradona had performed on an impressive level, but he would take his game even higher in the following matches against Uruguay, England and Belgium. In the final, his contribution was not that evident; West Germany did a great job to neutralize his impact, but they couldn’t stop him from deliver the perfect pass to Burruchaga that set him free against the goalkeeper Harald Schumacher to score the deciding 3-2 goal.</p>

                <h2>Messi's Argentina</h2>

                <p>The hopes for a third Argentine World Cup glory was when set with Maradona as coach and his inheritor on the pitch. Messi would however not be the savior that so many hoped for. Once again, Argentina would be overcome in a World Cup by Germany, this time in a humiliated fashion. Germany beat Argentina with 4-0 in Cape Town and for the fans of the Albiceleste it lay four years of waiting in front of them.</p>
                <p>In 2014, on South American soil, it was once again a World Cup that was anticipated by many to be “Messi’s tournament”. And at least, it would – almost – be Argentine’s. Brazil, perhaps the biggest favorite after all, were completely crushed in the semi-final. Argentina who had reach the final was not happy by the name of the opponents. According to the statistics Argentina hadn’t beat Germany (or West Germany) in a World Cup since 1986.</p>
                <p>Argentina played defensive in the final, perhaps not strange given the performance Germany had proven mighty of against Brazil. Close to the end of the extra time, Mario Götze would destroy the Argentine dreams.</p>
                <p>As the biggest star in the game at the time, Messi had enormous expectations to live up to in the 2018 World Cup. Already in the second game against Croatia, it stood clear that Argentina and Messi probably would deliver that many had expected. Argentina was beaten with three goals to none. Still, under hard pressure, Argentina had managed to take the second place in the group. But they were nevertheless eliminated by France – the soon-to-be champions – in a spectacular match.</p>
